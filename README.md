# Batak

<string>**Rules:**</strong>
Batak is a trick taking game played with 4 players and a 52 card deck.<br/>
Main purpose of the game is playing the biggest ranked card to the middle while following the suit and if you do that you will win that hand.
After the cards are distributed, players bid on how many hands they can win in this match and the highest bidder gets to be the main bidder and select the trump suit.
Cards with trump suits are special jokers which cannot be played unless they were forced to play.
Being forced to play means that if the player cannot follow the suit in the middle due to not having a card in their hand with the same suit, they can play the trump suit and win the hand.
After a trump was forced to play, players can start a round with trump cards.
This contunies until 13 rounds are completed and the players that lost the bid earn points depending on how many hands they won.
For the bidder, they earn points depending on the how many hands won if they won hands equal to or only 1 more than their bid.
If their won hands less or more than 2 than their bid, they lose points equal to their bid.

**Application**
I wanted to create a single player Batak game on console which can be implemented to Unity afterwards.
While the player commands will be input by user, computer players play the game according to their coding and adhering to the rules of the game.
GameVerifiers and CardVerifiers are classes that checks the plays adhere to game rules.
For the time being, the application is made for to be played on console; therefore added a simple UI for clearer display and feedback to the user.
